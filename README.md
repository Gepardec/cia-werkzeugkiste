# Tool Box Repo der Gepardec CIA-Gilde

This repository is developed and maintained by the Gepardec CIA-Gilde.
It contains various tools, utilities, guides and examples helping us in our daily work for our customers. 
We use this place to share the knowledge we gained.

## Structure of the Repo
Add a new folder for every new tool or utility you want to share.
Each folder should contain a README.md describing the purpose and usage of the tool.

## debug-images
In the "images" folder we develop Containerfiles for images needed for debugging and troubleshooting in customer environments.
The images are built and kept up-to-date automatically. 
Every image has its own folder with a README describing its purpose and usage.
